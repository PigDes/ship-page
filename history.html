			<h2>Under the Jolly Roger: 1800 - 1818</h2>

			<p>
				Lautaro was initially the British East Indiaman Windham (aka 'Wyndham'), built by Perry, Wells & Green at the Blackwall Shipyard for the East India Company (EIC) and launched in 1800. It performed six voyages for the EIC between 31 March 1801 and 25 June 1817, sailing to India from England, and back.Because she sailed during wartime, her owners arranged for to sail under a letter of marque, which gave her the right to take enemy vessels as prizes should the opportunity arise.
			</p>

			<p>
				On 8 October 1798, the EIC accepted a tender by William Wilson of Windham of 820 tons (bm) for six voyages. The rate was £19 19s per ton if she carried kintledge, £20 19s without kintledge, and £9 14s 6d per surplus ton.

			<h3>First voyage (1801-02)</h3>
			<p>
					Her first letter of marque was dated 14 January 1801 and gave the name of her captain as Thomas Grantham.[5] Windham's first voyage was to China. She left Portsmouth on 31 March 1801 and reached Saint Helena on 10 June and Whampoa on 7 October. On her return leg she crossed the Second Bar on 21 January 1802, reached Saint Helena on 12 April, and The Downs on 12 June.
			</p>

			<h3>Second voyage (1803-1804)</h3>

			<p>
				With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in mid-1803, Graham received a new letter of marque dated 2 July 1803.[5] This voyage took Windham to Madras and Bengal. She left The Downs on 11 February 1803 and reached Tincomallee on 16 June and Madras on 27 June. From these she sailed up and down the Indian coast, reaching Masulipatam on 7 August, Vizagapatam on 9 August, and Diamond Harbour on 21 August. Coming out of Calcutta she reached Kedgeree on 18 September and Madras on 16 October. She then returned to Diamond Harbour on 13 December. On the journey back to Britain she was back at Saugor on 5 January 1804, Vizagapatam on 27 January and Madras on 21 February. Windham was at Saint Helena between 24 March and 28 June, and reached The Downs on 9 October.

			<p>
				Windham had travelled from St Helena in convoy with the East Indiamen City of London, Ceylon, and Calcutta, two vessels from the South Seas, Lively and Vulture, and Rolla, which had transported convicts to New South Wales.[Note 1] Their escort was HMS Courageaux.[10] On the way the convoy ran into severe weather with the result that the Prince of Wales, which had also left St Helena with the rest, foundered with the loss of all on board; this had been her maiden voyage.

			<h2>' Primera Escuadra' in Chile 1818 - 1828</h2>
			<p>
				José Antonio Álvarez Condarco, agent of the Chilean government in London, arranged the purchase of the ship and the recruitment of unemployed naval officers and crew.[19][Note 2] Windham arrived at Valparaíso on 5 March 1818 and the government paid 180,000 pesos for the ship.[20] She was refitted with 44 guns, renamed Lautaro, and given a crew of Chilean and foreign seamen.[19][21] A month later she went to sea under the command of George O'Brien, a former Royal Navy officer.[19]

			<p>
				On 26–27 April 1818 she fought against the Spanish frigate Esmeralda and brigantine Pezuela outside Valparaiso. Although the attack on Esmeralda cost Captain O'Brien and his boarding party their lives, Lautaro did succeed in lifting the Spanish blockade of Valparaíso.[19] Later that year Lautaro, under the American, Captain Charles Wooster, was in the squadron under Commodore Blanco Encalada that surprised the relieving Spanish fleet at Talcahuano on 28 October. Lautaro and San Martín captured the Spanish frigate Reina María Isabel (later the Chilean frigate O'Higgins), the Perla, and the San Miguel.[22][23]

			<p>
				In the first half of 1819, after Lord Cochrane had taken command of the Chilean navy, Lautaro, under Captain Martin Guise, took part in the blockade of Callao, though a planned cutting out expedition against the Spanish fleet in the harbour was not successful.[24] On 7 November, returning to Peru, Lautaro and Galverino successfully attacked the shipping in the defended port of Pisco.[25] In 1820 she participated in the Freedom Expedition of Perú, culminating in the successful cutting out at Callao of the Spanish flagship Esmeralda by Cochrane and Guise on 5 November.
